#time series analysis - predicting from past data analysis based on time data
#non systematic something we cant capture like noise
#we cant split randomly our data as sometimes in our time series analysis in extreme situations only the data below x axis of the graph is taken 
#this makes the data wrong so we take only data in sequences
#if we can see some trend in noise then we can still extract some data from it
